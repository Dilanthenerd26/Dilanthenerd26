# Dilan-The-Nerd
Hey there!ðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜ƒ My name is Dilan Subhu Veerappan and I am currently studying at Dunman Secondary School. I am a 16 year old teenager residing in Singapore with a huge interest for coding and developing apps. Since the age of 7, I have coded simple programmes. With the knowledge I have gained over the past few years, I am looking to develop more high-end applications and develop my skill sets even more!
